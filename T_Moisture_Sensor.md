Sensing a soil moisture using the Soil Moisture sensor
-------------------------------------------

In this tutorial, we will use the soil moisture sensor to trigger a display event. We will also add an extension to MakeCode, to help us access the sensor readings.  Extensions only need to be added once.

## Step 2 Collect the parts. @unplugged
Collect the parts
-----------------
For this tutorial, you will need these parts:<br>
1x micro:bit, 1x GPIO shield, 1x Connector wire, 1x Soil moisture sensor<br><br>
![Parts Needed: 1x micro:bit, 1x GPIO shield, 1x Connector wire, 1x Soil moisture sensor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EarthEdSTEM/earthed-iot-programs-tutorials/master/Images/T_Soil_Moisture/IoT_Soil_Moisture_Sensor_Parts_List.png)
<br>

## Step 3 Connect up!
Physical connections
--------------------
1. Plug the micro:bit into the GPIO shield.
2. Use the wire to connect the soil moisture sensor to Pin 1 on the GPIO shield. 
3. Connect the other end of the wire to the soil moisture sensor.

## Step 4 Prepare to code!
Using MakeCode
------------------------------
The software we are using is called MakeCode. In these tutorials, if you see coloured words such as ``||basic: forever||``, 
this is a command that can be found and dragged out of a menu. The command colour corresponds with the menu colour. 
The commands click together like a jigsaw. 
If you need to delete blocks, dragging them to the menu bar will cause a 'bin' to appear. 
You can delete single blocks or groups of blocks, but make sure that you leave 
a ``||basic: forever||`` block and a ``||basic: on start||`` block on the work space.

## Step 5 Add the extension @unplugged
Coding: Add the Environment-and-Science-iot extension
----------------------------------------
An extension is code that is supplied by a developer to help 'extend' the functionality of the MakeCode app. Extensions add extra blocks to the block menu and only need to be added once. 
<br>The blocks for this tutorial are already present in the menu, however you will normally have to do the following:
1. Go to the ``||Extensions||`` menu and search for the **Environment-and-Science-iot** extension. 
2. Click the Environment-and-Science-iot extension to load it. New menu items will now appear, giving access to the ``||Extensions:Octopus||`` sensors.

## Step 6 Setting up the If...Then...Else
Coding: Setting up the if...then...else
--------------------------
If...Then...Else statements are a type of conditional statement. They are used to ask a question then act according to the response.
1. Click the ``|| Logic: if ||`` block in the ``|| Logic: Logic ||`` menu and place it in the ``|| basic: forever ||`` block.
2. Go to the  ``|| Logic: if ||`` block you just created and click the '+' sign to add a ``|| Logic: else ||`` .<br>
This creates the If...Then...Else statement.

```blocks
basic.forever(function () {
    if (true) {
    	
    } else {
    	
    }
})
```

## Step 7 Add a boolean operator
Coding: Add a boolean operator
----------------------------------------
In the ``|| Logic: If ||`` block there is a place holder. This is used to ask a question by adding values and operators.
1. Find the ``|| Logic: Less than ||`` block in the ``|| Logic: Logic ||`` menu and drag it into the ``|| Logic: if ||`` placeholder.
2. Go to the ``|| Extensions:Octopus ||`` menu and find the ``|| Extensions:Value of soil moisture ||`` block. Drag it into the first placeholder in the ``|| Logic: Less than ||`` block.
3. Enter the number '20' into the second placeholder.<br><br>
The code now asks "Is the soil moisture level less than 20?"

```blocks
basic.forever(function () {
    if (Environment.ReadSoilHumidity(AnalogPin.P1) < 20) {    
    } else {
    	
    }
})
```

## Step 8 Add an Action
Coding: Display an icon
----------------------------------------
Now that we have asked a question, we need to add an action if it is true. 
1. In the 'If' section of the If...Then...Else statement, add a ``|| basic: Show icon ||`` block.
2. Click the Icon to change it to a cross symbol.

```blocks
basic.forever(function () {
    if (Environment.ReadSoilHumidity(AnalogPin.P1) < 20) {
        basic.showIcon(IconNames.No)
    } else {
    	
    }
})
```

## Step 9 Add a Nested If Statement @showdialog
Coding: Nesting another 'if'
-------------------------------------
In programming it is important to create a structure. The term 'nested' refers to code that performs a specific function that is placed into other code. 
This often appears like layers of code.
1. In the 'Else' section you created earlier, add an ``|| Logic: if ||`` block.
2. Create another boolean and add it to the new ``|| Logic: if ||`` as per the previous step, except make it a 'Larger than 80' value.
3. Add an umbrella icon.<br>
Now, if the value is over 80, an umbrella will be displayed.

```blocks
basic.forever(function () {
    if (Environment.ReadSoilHumidity(AnalogPin.P1) < 20) {
        basic.showIcon(IconNames.No)
    } else {
        if (Environment.ReadSoilHumidity(AnalogPin.P1) > 80) {
            basic.showIcon(IconNames.Umbrella)
        }
    	
    }
})
```
## Step 10 Add a Nested If Statement
Coding: Add another else
-------------------------------------
1. In the nested ``|| Logic: if ||`` block you just created, click **'+'** to add a ``|| Logic: else ||`` section.
2. Add a tick icon.

```blocks
basic.forever(function () {
    if (Environment.ReadSoilHumidity(AnalogPin.P1) < 20) {
        basic.showIcon(IconNames.No)
    } else {
        if (Environment.ReadSoilHumidity(AnalogPin.P1) > 80) {
            basic.showIcon(IconNames.Umbrella)
        } else {
            basic.showIcon(IconNames.Yes)
        }
    }
})
```
** Note: In the sample code shown here, the join block has been used to added to items of text together.
 
## Step 9 Test It
Test it! Debug it!
------------------
Time to test your code. Download the code to the micro: bit and try it out. Observe what happens.<br>
How could you integrate this sensor to control an agricultural IoT device?<br><br>
