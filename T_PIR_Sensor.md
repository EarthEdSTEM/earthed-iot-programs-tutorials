## Step 1 - Detect Motion @showdialog

Detect motion
---------------------------------

In this tutorial we will use a Passive Infra-Red (PIR) sensor as an input to trigger a LED. A PIR sensor works by detecting heat as an object passes by it.

## Step 2 - Collect the parts. @unplugged
Collect the parts
-----------------
For this tutorial, you will need these parts: <br>
1x micro:bit, GPIO shield, 1x Connector Wire, 1x PIR Sensor, 1x LED <br><br>
![Parts Needed: 1x GPIO shield, 1x micro:bit, 1x Connector Wire, 1x PIR Sensor, 1x LED](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EarthEdSTEM/earthed-iot-programs-tutorials/master/Images/T_PIR_Sensor/IoT_PIR_Sensor_Parts_List.png)
<br>

## Step 3 - Connect Up!
Connect the parts together
--------------------------
1. Plug the micro: bit into the GPIO shield.
2. Connect the wire to Pin 1 on the GPIO shield.
3. Connect the other end of the wire to the PIR sensor.
4. Connect the LED to Pin 2 using the same method.

## Step 4 - Prepare to Code!
Using MakeCode
------------------------------
The software we are using is called MakeCode. In these tutorials, if you see coloured words such as ``||basic: forever||``, 
this is a command that can be found and dragged out of a menu. The command colour corresponds with the menu colour. 
The commands click together like a jigsaw. 
If you need to delete blocks, dragging them to the menu bar will cause a 'bin' to appear. 
You can delete single blocks or groups of blocks, but make sure that you leave 
a ``||basic: forever||`` block and a ``||basic: on start||`` block on the work space.

## Step 5 Add the Extension @unplugged
Coding: Add the SmartHome-Kit extension
----------------------------------------
An extension is code that is supplied by a developer to help 'extend' the functionality of the MakeCode app. Extensions add extra blocks to the block menu and only need to be added once. 
<br>The blocks for this tutorial are already present in the menu, however you will normally have to do the following:
1. Go to the ``||Extensions||`` menu and search for the **SmartHome-Kit** extension. 
2. Click the Environment-and-Science-iot extension to load it. New menu items will now appear, giving access to the ``||Extensions:Octopus||`` sensors.

## Step 6 Setting up the If...Then...Else
Coding: Setting up the if...then...else
--------------------------
if...then...else statements are a type of conditional statement. They are used to ask a question then act according to the response.
1. Click the ``|| Logic: if ||`` block in the ``|| Logic ||`` menu and place it in the ``|| Basic: forever ||`` block.
2. Go to the  ``|| Logic: if ||`` block you just created and click the **'+'** button to add an ``|| Logic: else ||`` section.<br>
This creates the if...then...else statement.

```blocks
if (true) {
	
} else {
	
}
basic.forever(function () {
	
})
```

## Step 7 Ask the question
Coding: Ask the question
--------------------------
Next, we will set up the query. We will ask: **"Is the PIR sensor detecting movement?"**
1. Navigate to the ``|| SmartHome ||`` menu. 
2. Select the ``|| SmartHome: PIR sensor detects motion ||`` block and drag it into the place holder in the ``|| Logic: if ||`` block.
3. Ensure that the pin number is set to **Pin 1**.

```blocks
if (smarthome.PIR(DigitalPin.P1)) {
    
} else {
    
}
basic.forever(function () {
	
})
```

## Step 8 Set the Response
Coding: Set the response
--------------------------
Once the ``|| Logic: if ||`` is set then we need to state what happens - **If** motion is true, **then** turn on LED at Pin 2.
1. Navigate to the ``|| SmartHome ||`` menu. 
2. Select the ``|| SmartHome: Toggle LED to ||`` block and drag it into the ``|| Logic: if ||`` block.
3. Ensure that the pin number is set to **Pin 2** and that the toggle is set to **on**.
4. Add a ``|| Basic: pause ||`` below the LED block and set the duration to **1000**. When you have finished this tutorial, try adjusting this pause to see what happens.

```blocks
if (smarthome.PIR(DigitalPin.P1)) {
    smarthome.ledBrightness(AnalogPin.P2, true)
    basic.pause(1000)
} else {

}
basic.forever(function () {
	
})
```
## Step 9 What Else?
Coding: Use the Else command
--------------------------
The **else** command states what happens if the condition is not true. If (**else) motion is not true, turn off LED at Pin 2.
1. Navigate to the ``|| SmartHome ||`` menu. 
2. Select the ``|| SmartHome: Toggle LED to ||`` block and drag it into the ``|| Logic: else ||`` section of the ``|| Logic: If ||`` block.
3. Ensure that the ``|| SmartHome: Toggle LED to ||`` block is set to Pin 2 and that the toggle is set to **off**.

```blocks
if (smarthome.PIR(DigitalPin.P1)) {
    smarthome.ledBrightness(AnalogPin.P2, true)
    basic.pause(1000)
} else {
    smarthome.ledBrightness(AnalogPin.P2, false)
}
basic.forever(function () {
	
})
```

## Step 10 - Test It
Test It! Debug it!
------------------
Time to test your code. Download the code to the micro:bit and try it out. Observe what happens and adjust the values as needed.<br>
In what ways could a PIR (Passive Infrared motion) detector be used in real life? How could you simulate that use?<br><br>
