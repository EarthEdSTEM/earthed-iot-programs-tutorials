About this section
-----------------
In the previous section, we created an IoT actuator device (in this case a fan). In this section, we will create code to simulate the Gateway. In an IoT system, the gateway would be connected to the internet.<br>
If you haven't done so already, disconnect the previous micro:bit from your computer.<br>
Connect and pair the micro:bit you intend to use as the Gateway.
**This is part two of this tutorial sequence.**<br>

## Section 1 - Code the gateway device

Code the gateway device
---------------------
The Gateway device transmits and receives data between the IoT control and actuator devices and the server or 'Cloud'. 
In this tutorial we will code a micro:bit computer to receive data from a sensor and then switch on a fan depending on the value of the data.

### Step 1 Connections
Connections
-----------------
Connect the components and then set the Radio Group to the one used in the previous section.
1. Connect one micro:bit, one IoT:Bit, one battery pack and one connector wire.
2. Drag a ``||radio: Set Radio Group||`` block into the ``||Basic: on start||`` block.<br>
3. Set the **Radio Group to 1**.
```blocks
radio.setGroup(1)
```
### Step 2 Receive a string via radio
Receive a string via radio
-----------------
For this tutorial, the Gateway will listen for an 'OverTemp' string message sent from a sensor, 
which when true, will lead to trigger signal being sent to an actuator (fan). 
Add the receiver and then an **if** conditional statement.
1. **Drag** a ``||radio: on radio received receivedString||`` block on to the desktop.
2. **Place** an ``||Logic:if||`` block inside the ``||radio: on radio received receivedString||`` block.

```blocks
radio.onReceivedString(function (receivedString) {
    if () {

    }
})
```

### Step 3 Receive a string via radio cont.
Receive a string via radio cont.
-----------------
Next we will add a boolean to check the if string received from the sensor device equals the value 'OverTemp'. 
This string text can say anything, but should relate to the sensor you are using - in this case, a thermometer.<br>
1. **Drag** an ``||Logic: = ||`` boolean block into the placeholder on the ``||Logic:if||`` block.
2. **Drag** the ``||Radio:receivedString||`` from the place holder in the ``||radio: on radio received receivedString||`` block to the **first** placeholder in the ``||Logic: = ||`` boolean block.
3. Type **'OverTemp'** into the **second** placeholder.


```blocks
radio.onReceivedString(function (receivedString) {
    if (receivedString == "OverTemp") {
      
    }
})
```

### Step 4 Transmit a string if condition is true.
Transmit a string if condition is true
-----------------
If 'OverTemp' string is received from the temperature sensor ("OverTemp" is true), then send a "FanOn" string to the fan actuator. <br>
1. **Place** a ``||Radio:radio send string||`` into the ``||Logic:if||`` block.
2. Type **'FanOn'** into the placeholder.

```blocks
radio.onReceivedString(function (receivedString) {
    if (receivedString == "OverTemp") {
        radio.sendString("FanOn")
    }
})
radio.setGroup(1)
```

### Step 5 Transmit a string via radio
Transmit a string via radio
-----------------
If the 'OverTemp' condition is not true (the string contains a different value), then send a 'FanOff' string to the fan actuator.
1. Click the **+** to add an else command.
2. **Place** a ``||Radio:radio send string||`` into the ``||Logic:else||`` block.
2. Type **'FanOff'** into the placeholder.

```blocks
radio.onReceivedString(function (receivedString) {
    if (receivedString == "OverTemp") {
        radio.sendString("FanOn")
    } else {
        radio.sendString("FanOff")
    }
})
radio.setGroup(1)
```
